## My process
  1. HTML Structure

  First, I set up the basic HTML structure. I started with a main container, a div, to hold everything. Then, inside that, I added an img tag for the QR code image. After the image, I added another div to contain the text ‚Äì the heading and the paragraph.

2. CSS Styling

  Next, I moved on to styling with CSS. I centered the whole component on the page, and then styled the container as a card. I gave it a white background, rounded the corners, and added a shadow to make it stand out. I also styled the text, setting the font, size, and centering it within the card.

3. Making it Responsive

  Finally, to make sure it looks good on all devices, I made it responsive. I used CSS, probably media queries, to adjust the layout and sizing for different screen sizes, so it works well on both desktops and phones.

## Simplified Code Structure

************ Here's a simplified version of the code I used ***************************
 <div class="container">
      <div class="child">
         <img src="/images/image-qr-code.png" alt="">
         <h4>Improve your front-end <br> skills by building projects</h4>
         <p>Scan the QR code to visit Frontend <br> Mentor and take your coding skills to <br> the next level</p>
      </div>
     </div>

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Google font-family](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) - For styles

### What I learned

Structuring a webpage with HTML, including using div elements for layout and adding images and text.
Styling elements with CSS, such as centering, setting backgrounds, rounding corners, adding shadows, and styling text.
Making a webpage responsive using CSS, likely involving media queries, which was a war üòÇ ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üòÇ.



### Continued development

While building the QR code component, I gained a foundational understanding of HTML and CSS. I learned how to structure content, apply basic styling, and create a simple layout.

However, I want to focus on improving my ability to create responsive designs. I aim to master techniques like media queries, flexbox, and grid layout to build web pages that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
